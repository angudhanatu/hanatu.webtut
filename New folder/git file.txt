<title>the amazing benefits of sesame seeds</title>
<p><i>Sesame seeds are tiny, oil-rich seeds that grow in pods on
 the Sesamum indicum plant.</i></p>
<b>Unhulled </b> seeds have the outer, edible husk intact, while 
hulld seeds come without the husk.
	The hull gives the seeds a golden-brown hue. Hulled seeds 
have an off-white color but turn brown when roasted.
Sesame seeds have many potential health benefits and have
 been used in folk medicine for thousands of years. 
 They may protect against heart disease, diabetes, and 
 arthritis (1Trusted Source).
However, you may need to eat significant amounts — a small
 handful per day — to gain health benefits.
Here are 15 health benefits of sesame seeds.

<p>
<br>1.  Source of Fiber</br>
Three tablespoons (30 grams) of unhulled sesame seeds provide 3.5 grams of fiber, which is 12% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).
Since the average fiber intake in the United States is only half of the<emphasis>
 RDI,</emphasis>
 eating sesame seeds regularly could help increase your fiber intake (4Trusted Source).
Fiber is well known for supporting digestive health. Additionally, growing evidence suggests that fiber may play a role in reducing your risk of heart disease, certain cancers, obesity, and type 2 diabetes (4Trusted Source).
SUMMARYA 3-tablespoon (30-gram) serving of sesame seeds supplies 12% of the RDI for fiber, which is vital for your digestive health.</P>
2. May Lower Cholesterol and Triglycerides
Some studies suggest that regularly eating sesame seeds may help decrease high cholesterol and triglycerides — which are risk factors for heart disease (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).
Sesame seeds consist of 15% saturated fat, 41% polyunsaturated fat, and 39% monounsaturated fat (3Trusted Source).
Research indicates that eating more polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat relative to saturated fat may help lower your cholesterol and reduce heart disease risk (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).
